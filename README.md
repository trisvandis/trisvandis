### Hi there, I'm Tristan 👋

<details>
<summary>About me</summary>
With over 10 years experience working for Network Rail, currently managing the Development Team on the North East Route and developing the access plan for future years.  I work with various stakeholders to develop an planning strategy for accessing and maintaining the railway across North East England, which includes resolving cross-route conflicts and disputes and agreeing late notice disruptive change.

An aspiring data scientist, I am currently undertaking bootcamp with HyperionDev in my spare time to hone my programming and data analysis skills. After learning how to code during my MSc degree at York, I have continued to expand my knowledge and have taught myself to code in a number of languages such as Python, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, MYSQL, Bootstrap, Django. I also have experience building websites (in my spare time) and writing databases.
